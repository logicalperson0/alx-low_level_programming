C - Search Algorithms
=====================

This was my ALX project on search algorithms. I implemented various types of search algorithms and stated the corresponding space/time complexities for each.

Header File
============

search_algos.h: Header file containing definitions and prototypes for all types and functions written for the project.

Tasks
========

0. Linear search

0-linear.c: C function that searches for a value in an array of integers using linear search.

1. Binary search

1-binary.c: C function that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using binary search.
Assumes the array is sorted in ascending order and that the value to search for is not repeated in the array.

2. Big O #0

2-O: Text file containing the worst case time complexity of linear search.

3. Big O #1

3-O: Text file containing the worst case space complexity of iterative linear search.

4. Big O #2

4-O: Text file containing worst case case time complexity of binary search.

5. Big O #3

5-O: Text file containing the worst case space complexity of binary search.

6. Big O #4

6-O: Text file containing the space complexity of the following algorithm:

7. Jump search

100-jump.c: C function that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using jump search.
Uses the square root of the size of the array as the jump step.

8. Big O #5

101-O: Text file containing the average case time complexity of jump search in an array of size n using step = sqrt(n).

9. Interpolation search

102-interpolation.c: C function that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using interpolation search.
Assumes the array is sorted in ascending order.

10. Exponential search

103-exponential.c: C function that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using exponential search.
Uses powers of 2 as exponential ranges to search the array.
Assumes the array is sorted in ascending order.
